This is the starting point for assignment three in CSCI 3310.

The capture.c file is identical to the lab9.c file and is the
starting point for this assignment.  There is also a Makefile
that will build your program.

There are two capture files in this folder that you can use
to test your program.  These files are:

test.anon - This is the file for laboratory 9. 

small.anon - This is the file that you need to process for this assignment.
