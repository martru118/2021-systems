This is the starting point for assignment one in CSCI 3310.

I've provided the command line parser for you.  It is in the file parser.c.
I've also provided a makefile for you.  Your code should go in the exec.c
file.  This has already been started for you, with the include files and
a few lines for the function that you must implement.

The data structure produced by the parser is declared in mysh.h.  The comments
describe the various parts of the data structure.  You can use the makefile
to build the current version of the program.  The existing code will read
commands and parse, so you will start with a working program.

Remember to commit and push often.  This will make it easier for us
to help you.  If we have an up to date solution on GitHub, we
can build and run it ourselves.  There is no need to email program code 
and output to us.
